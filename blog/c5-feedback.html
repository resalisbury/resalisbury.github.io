        <p>DBC isn&rsquo;t just about teaching you to code.  It&rsquo;s also about learning to code with others.  Pairing is an essential part of the curriculum at DBC that I&rsquo;ve really come to appreciate.  Every pairing sessions starts with a discussion of pairing preferences, before moving onto the coding challenge.  After the challenge is completed, I always try to reflect on what went well, what went poorly, and what we could try to do differently next time.  After the pairing session, giving feedback is mandatory.  Since pairing occurs about 3 times a week, after the first month, you will not only have received peer and mentor feedback about 12 times, you&rsquo;ll also have written a similar amount of feedback for others.
        </p>
        <p>The feedback you write is passed along anonymously to other members of the cohort who rate it according to how actionable specific and kind it is.  Developing the habit of giving and receiving feedback is great.  I&rsquo;m my professional experience, feedback is largely limited to perfunctory semi annual reviews, which are largely ignored.  Not particularly effective.
        </p>
        <p>Giving and receiving feedback is inherently uncomfortable, which is part of the reason it necessitates practice.  Opening the first few pieces of feedback I received made me feel a little nervous, but also excited.  I wanted to know how others had perceived our pairing sessions and if those perceptions differed from mine.
        </p>
        <p>The feedback I received that was helpful ranged from very specific items to broader concepts.  Here are a few of the examples (1) “discuss time restraints at the beginning of the session” (2) “at times it felt like you were waiting for me to tell you what to type, but I really would've preferred to collaborate on creating the content” (3) “some times I felt like you were moving a little too fast”.
        </p>
        <p>In giving feedback, the hardest thing has been to give actionable feedback.  Being kind is and specific is relatively easy, but actionable feedback can feel confrontational and unkind.  It&rsquo;s also hard to know what sort of actionable feedback is appropriate.  Do you suggest, “read chapter 3 of the well grounded rubyist”  or “make sure not to interrupt your pair too often”?  It depends on the situation and there are some many different situations.  Suffice it to say, it takes a lot of practice.
        </p>
        <p>The first few pieces of feedback I wrote were specific and kind, but not at all actionable.  Writing actionable feedback is definitely something I am working on.  I&rsquo;ve already gotten a lot better, but still have a long way to go.
