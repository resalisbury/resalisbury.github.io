        <span class="date">11/02/14 </span><span class="tag">(cultural)</span>
        <p>If we want to reimagine how our financial system is structured and design it around the end user there are two problems we need to solve.  First, identity verification, and, second, value transfer.</p>

        <span class="date">10/23/14 </span><span class="tag">(cultural)</span>
        <p>I&rsquo;m now through my first 3 weeks at Dev Bootcamp (DBC), and, after just 3 weeks, I feel much further along than after 3 years of haphazard self directed learning. Here&rsquo;s why.</p>

        <span class="date">10/19/14 </span><span class="tag">(technical)</span>

        <span class="date">10/10/14 </span><span class="tag">(cultural)</span>
        <p>My educational philosophy has been informed by many forces, not least among these my own experience as a student, and most recently by my wife, Allison, and her work building summer programs for students at Davidson College through her role as Director of Special Projects in the president's office.  I see a lot of the values she designs into her programs reflected at Dev Bootcamp.</p>

        <p>Git is an incredibly popular free open source distributed version control.  Like any version control software, it helps to track and merge changes to projects.</p>
